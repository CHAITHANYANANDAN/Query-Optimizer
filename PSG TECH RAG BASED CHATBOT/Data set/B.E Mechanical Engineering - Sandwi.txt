B.E Mechanical Engineering - Sandwich, since 1983
Programme Coordinator : Dr.Ramesh Babu A


The five-year Sandwich Mechanical programme, started in the year 1983, is a well-balanced blend of academic courses providing theoretical concepts supplemented by Industrial Training providing practical Industry-specific skills and inputs to students. During the five-year programme, students undergo a rigorous regimen of Industrial Training starting from basics of Industry and applications of time-tested scientific postulates and concepts in Industry, to full-fledged Internships at various real Industries and Institutions. The Industrial Training provides a real-world application dimension to concepts studies in various theory courses. The Industry Training curriculum has been carefully put together in order to provide the right inputs to the students. Students learn the basics of Engineering skills by actual hands-on exercises in areas like Fitting, Foundry practice, Electrical Engineering fundamentals and Civil Engineering concepts. As the students mature and move ahead within their five-year programme, they are also exposed to current software packages based on Manufacturing and Mechanical Engineering concepts. Towards their pre-final and final years, students are provided inputs of a managerial nature like Industrial governance and statutes, Financial planning and indices and Industrial Project Management skills which prepare them for placement, higher studies and entrepreneurship in their future careers. In short, the Industrial Training undergone by the students of Sandwich Mechanical Engineering over five years provides the right ingredients and hands-on skills, internships and software skills. All of these, prepare the students for real-world careers and makes them Industry-ready.
