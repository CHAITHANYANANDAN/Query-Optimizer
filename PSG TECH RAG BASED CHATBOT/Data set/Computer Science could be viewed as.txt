Computer Science could be viewed as a discipline supported by the pillars - Hardware, Software, Systems Software and the Theory behind computing. Though started in the middle of 20th Century, this discipline has seen rapid changes and the fastest growth ever since mankind has started. Currently, Computing has become inseparable from Human life.

It has found a prominent place in our day to day life and we are struggling to cope with it. The mission of Computer Science & Engineering department is to impart knowledge to students and researchers to pave a solid foundation in problem solving using computers. The department has been started in the year 1987 and as of today, it offers an undergraduate program B.E (CSE) and two Post graduate programs viz., M.E (CSE) and M.E (Software Engg).
