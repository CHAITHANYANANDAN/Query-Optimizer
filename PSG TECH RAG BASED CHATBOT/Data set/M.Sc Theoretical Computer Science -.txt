M.Sc Theoretical Computer Science - Integrated, since 2007
Programme Coordinator : Dr.Poonthalir G


The Five year integrated M.Sc. Theoretical Computer Science is an innovative research oriented programme introduced by PSG College of Technology during the year 2007 in collaboration with leading software houses. Any industry grows only if it has a strong R & D division. In order that Research be fruitful, the R & D team should have persons with strong theoretical background. "It is the theory that describes what can be observed", said Albert Einstein. M. Sc Theoretical Computer Science has been designed to augment human resources for the R & D divisions of software industries.
