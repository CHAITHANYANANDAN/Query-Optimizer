BE Metallurgical Engineering is a comprehensive program designed to provide students with a deep understanding of metallurgy, particularly metals and alloys. The programme focusses on the principles of physical metallurgy, materials processing, heat treatment, and the behaviour of materials under various conditions. It aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, preparing them to excel in industries related to metals, materials, and manufacturing. Spanning four years, the program covers core subjects such as extractive metallurgy, metallurgical thermodynamics, materials characterization, mechanical behaviour of materials, and failure analysis. Students gain hands-on experience in state-of-the-art laboratories focusing on material testing, casting, welding, and advanced material processing techniques. The curriculum is tailored to meet industry demands, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared for careers across diverse sectors. Emerging trends like additive manufacturing, computational techniques, and simulations are also integrated into the program. In addition to academic rigor, the program fosters research and innovation by encouraging students to participate in industry projects and internships with leading companies and R&D laboratories. The department creates an environment of practical exposure, cultivating skilled metallurgical engineers capable of addressing current challenges in materials and metallurgical technology. The BE Metallurgical Engineering program at PSG College of Technology stands as a premier choice for aspiring engineers in this specialized field since 1968.
