BSc Applied Science, since 1971

Programme Coordinator : Dr.Vaideki K


Applied science helps shape the world around us. It is vital to aerospace, energy, construction, and healthcare and even information technology. It has the power to improve the quantity of life and protect the environment. The course will provide a solid grounding in the science of materials and shows how to apply this knowledge to problems in the real world. Learn how to tailor the structure, composition and processing of materials to meet design requirements. Moreover, the scientists and engineers groomed under the 3 years UG programme viz., B.Sc Applied science is actively involved in product research at different places like fortune software companies, IGCAR, BARC, DRDO, ISRO, DMRL, ARDE, GE, GM, CUMI, HHV, IISc, IIT and in many foreign universities holding higher positions. On the other hand, the programmes supported the institute to get research projects from funding agencies like DST, UGC, AICTE, DRDO, ISRO,BRNS etc.,. Collaborations with industries, Government agencies and other institutions have lead to research contributions in a wide range of fields. Several project works of these students have been successfully converted into journal articles and have been published in standard peer reviewed journals. The uniqueness of these programmes is that it can be offered only in an Engineering Environment. These programmes promote interdisciplinary research activities in the institute. The department offers M.Phil and Doctoral programmes both full time and part time. The research work in the department focuses on cutting edge technologies like Thin Films, Organic Spintronics, MEMS, Solar Cells, Piezoelectric Ceramic Sensors, Radiation Dosimetry, Health care materials processing Non Linear Dynamics and Molecular Quantum Mechanics.
