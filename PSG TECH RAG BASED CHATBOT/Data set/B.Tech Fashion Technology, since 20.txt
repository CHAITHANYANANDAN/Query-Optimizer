Accrediation Status : upto 30/06/2028

B.Tech Fashion Technology (from 2006) is structured with core and elective subjects to meet the technological and managerial needs of the fashion industry and to take care of the needs of placement, career growth and personal aspiration of the students. After a good foundation in communication skills, applied maths & science and textile technology, strong emphasis is given to apparel technology, management and computer application, keeping in pace with the revolution in information technology. While the industrial training imparted offers the students the much needed exposure to the industrial practice and current trends, the project work gives a capstone experience to improve their technical acumen, analytical skill, research oriented approach and problem solving capability.
