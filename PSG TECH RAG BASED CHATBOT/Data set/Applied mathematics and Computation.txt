The Department of Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences (AMCS) at PSG College of Technology is the largest and one of the most dynamic departments in the institution, committed to the vision “Stay Ahead and Be Relevant.” It offers five graduate and one undergraduate program, integrating strong mathematical foundations with advanced computer science applications. The five-year integrated M.Sc. Software Systems program (established in 1997) prepares students for global software industries by emphasizing resilient application development and software design. The M.Sc. Theoretical Computer Science program (since 2007) caters to R&D and academic institutions with a focus on computational theory. The M.Sc. Data Science program (since 2015) addresses big data analytics, machine learning, and dimensionality reduction challenges. The M.Sc. Cyber Security program (started in 2020) is one of India’s first integrated programs designed to produce cybersecurity experts through technical training and industrial internships. The long-standing M.Sc. Applied Mathematics program (since 1975) blends core mathematics with software and systems applications in science and engineering. The B.Sc. Computer Systems & Design undergraduate program (since 1985) develops essential programming, system design, and IT problem-solving skills. The department boasts a faculty of over 60 members with research strengths in mathematical modeling, topology, epidemic modeling, graph algorithms, applied machine learning, and cybersecurity. Their contributions in research, publications, and curriculum development position AMCS as a hub of academic excellence and innovation, bridging industry demands and academic rigor.
